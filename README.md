# House Price Prediction

The Goal of this project:
The main aim of this project is to predict the house price with best RMSE based on various features by going through below steps:

Step 1: Giving a look into the dataset's features through some simple EAD
Step 2: Performing all the below steps in Feature Engineering:
        Missing values treatment
        Categorical variables: remove rare labels
        Create new features from existing features
        Selecting appropriate data transformation methods
        Standarise the values of the variables to the same range
Step 3: Finding variables that are most predictive of the sale prices.
Step 4: About Modeling:
        The regularized linear models ridge and lasso, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree and various ensemble models were used in fitting the data with hyper parameter               tuning
